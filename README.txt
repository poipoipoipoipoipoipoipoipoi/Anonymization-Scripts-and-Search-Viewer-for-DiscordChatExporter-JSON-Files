      "content": "Let me give you an example that is both bad and good. Suppose a person is ill and needs surgery to treat the illness, but the surgery itself is painful. In this case, the value of the surgery is something that everyone “records in their ledger.” However, suppose there are two types of surgery that are identical in terms of treating the illness itself, but one is more painful than the other. If the choice is made to intentionally opt for the more painful surgery to enhance the patient’s character and temper their spirit, the value behind this decision may or may not be “recorded in the ledger,” and opinions on this vary among different people. If you were to perform the more painful surgery regardless, and it resulted in the patient's character and spirit deteriorating rather than improving, or if the patient felt anger, hatred, and rebellion because they did not voluntarily choose the surgery, this could be interpreted as a signal not to perform the more painful surgery, or as a signal that the surgery should be more painful to better enhance their character and spirit. Opinions on this matter would also vary among different people.",
